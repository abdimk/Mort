## About
<p> Mort is a real-time distributed cache built for high-performance systems. Written in Go, it provides ultra-low latency data access, automatic distribution across nodes,and efficient memory management. Mort is designed to handle large-scale workloads with features like intelligent caching, horizontal scalability, and high availability,making it ideal for modern applications, microservices, and data-intensive platforms that need fast and reliable data access. </p>


> [!NOTE]
> This is Expermental and the core idea of the project is to impliment all the feauture that redis had and improve the thing that
> Implement the core features Redis has (must-have)
> Add features Redis lacks or does poorly (differentiation)
> Leverage Go strengths (concurrency, networking)
